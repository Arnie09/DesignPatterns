# Design Patterns

Software engineering techniques using OOPs concepts aimed at solving commonly faced problems in SWE.

# Where to use what:

## Adapter Pattern: 

    Adapter pattern is used as the name suggests, to adapt the objects of one class with another so as to remove any
    incompatibility isses between the objects. Commonly used in UI elements.

## Factory Pattern:

    Factory Pattern helps to generate proper objects following a set of rules. Basically it can produce objects of multiple types.

## Observer Pattern:

    An observer pattern is the design pattern used to look out for changes in something. Observers can be added and removed and they 
    will be notified in case of any changes to the Observable object

## Singleton Pattern:

    Singleton Patterns are used when we need to have only one object of a class in memory.

## State Pattern:

    State Patterns are patterns in which we maintain various states of an object using a context and the different states are represented
    by objects.

## Strategy Pattern:

    Stategy Pattern is the design pattern that encourages us to make interfaces for objects that are likely to change in future.
